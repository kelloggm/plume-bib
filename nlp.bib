   "Readers of programs have two main sources of domain information:
    identifier names and comments. When functions are uncommented, as many are,
    comprehension is almost exclusively dependent on the identifier
    names. Assuming that writers of programs want to create quality identifiers
    (e.g., identifiers that include relevant domain knowledge), one must ask
    how should they go about it. For example, do the initials of a concept name
    provide enough information to represent the concept? If not, and a longer
    identifier is needed, is an abbreviation satisfactory or does the concept
    need to be captured in an identifier that includes full words? What is the
    effect of longer identifiers on limited short term memory capacity? Results
    from a study designed to investigate these questions are reported. The
    study involved over 100 programmers who were asked to describe 12 different
    functions and then recall identifiers that appeared in each function. The
    functions used three different levels of identifiers: single letters,
    abbreviations, and full words. Responses allow the extent of comprehension
    associated with the different levels to be studied along with their impact
    on memory. The functions used in the study include standard computer
    science textbook algorithms and functions extracted from production
    code. The results show that full-word identifiers lead to the best
    comprehension; however, in many cases, there is no statistical difference
    between using full words and abbreviations. When considered in the light of
    limited human short-term memory, well-chosen abbreviations may be
    preferable in some situations since identifiers with fewer syllables are
    easier to remember.",
