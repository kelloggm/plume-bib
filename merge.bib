abstract = {In modern software development, developers rely on version control systems like Git to collaborate in the branch-based development workflow. One downside of this workflow is the conflicts occurred when merging contributions from different developers: these conflicts are tedious and error-prone to be correctly resolved, reducing the efficiency of collaboration and introducing potential bugs. The situation becomes even worse, with the popularity of refactorings in software development and evolution, because current merging tools (usually based on the text or tree structures of source code) are unaware of refactorings. In this paper, we present IntelliMerge, a graph-based refactoring-aware merging algorithm for Java programs. We explicitly enhance this algorithm's ability in detecting and resolving refactoring-related conflicts. Through the evaluation on 1,070 merge scenarios from 10 popular open-source Java projects, we show that IntelliMerge reduces the number of merge conflicts by 58.90% comparing with GitMerge (the prevalent unstructured merging tool) and 11.84% comparing with jFSTMerge (the state-of-the-art semi-structured merging tool) without sacrificing the auto-merging precision (88.48%) and recall (90.22%). Besides, the evaluation of performance shows that IntelliMerge takes 539 milliseconds to process one merge scenario on the median, which indicates its feasibility in real-world applications.},

abstract = {Even though many programmers rely on 3-way merge tools to integrate changes from different branches, such tools can introduce subtle bugs in the integration process. This paper aims to mitigate this problem by defining a semantic notion of conflict-freedom, which ensures that the merged program does not introduce new unwanted behaviors. We also show how to verify this property using a novel, compositional algorithm that combines lightweight summarization for shared program fragments with precise relational reasoning for the modifications. Towards this goal, our method uses a 4-way differencing algorithm on abstract syntax trees to represent different program versions as edits applied to a shared program with holes. This representation allows our verification algorithm to reason about different edits in isolation and compose them to obtain an overall proof of conflict freedom. We have implemented the proposed technique in a new tool called SafeMerge for Java and evaluate it on 52 real-world merge scenarios obtained from Github. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over syntactic conflict-freedom and indicate that SafeMerge is both precise and practical.},

abstract = {An ongoing problem in revision control systems is how to resolve conflicts in a merge of independently developed revisions. Unstructured revision control systems are purely text-based and solve conflicts based on textual similarity. Structured revision control systems are tailored to specific languages and use language-specific knowledge for conflict resolution. We propose semistructured revision control systems that inherit the strengths of both: the generality of unstructured systems and the expressiveness of structured systems. The idea is to provide structural information of the underlying software artifacts --- declaratively, in the form of annotated grammars. This way, a wide variety of languages can be supported and the information provided can assist in the automatic resolution of two classes of conflicts: ordering conflicts and semantic conflicts. The former can be resolved independently of the language and the latter using specific conflict handlers. We have been developing a tool that supports semistructured merge and conducted an empirical study on 24 software projects developed in Java, C#, and Python comprising 180 merge scenarios. We found that semistructured merge reduces the number of conflicts in 60% of the sample merge scenarios by, on average, 34%, compared to unstructured merge. We found also that renaming is challenging in that it can increase the number of conflicts during semistructured merge, and that a combination of unstructured and semistructured merge is a pragmatic way to go.},
